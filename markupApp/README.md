# Markup: A In-depth Markdown Editor

## Purpose
This app serves to allow devs to learn the ropes of Markdown, quickly preview and edit their file, and export their file for their projects.

## Pain Points
Sometimes I feel like I'm *still* finding out new things about Markdown, and different text styles I can apply in my files. For example, did you know you can <span style="color: red">Use inline styling *IN YOUR FILE?* </span>

Crazy, right? Shouldn't there be a place where you can LEARN some of the basic Markdown syntax in a more familiar format?

## Tech Stack
* [ElectronJS](https://www.electronjs.org/)
* [React.js](https://react.dev/)
* [Draft.js](https://draftjs.org/)
* [Marked.js](https://marked.js.org/)

## What's Next?

Up next, I want to:
*  Add custom styles for users
* Make user accounts
* Add Filesharing
* Add more Markdown features to the preview side of the app.
